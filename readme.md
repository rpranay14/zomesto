üçî MERN Web App Inspired by Zomato üçï

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the features of the Zomato web app. It includes both frontend and backend components to provide a complete user experience. The frontend is built using React, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the database.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. `frontend`: Contains the React frontend application.
2. `backend`: Contains the Node.js, Express, and MongoDB backend application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed. Download them from https://nodejs.org/.
- MongoDB should be installed and running. Download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. Create a new project in Mongodb and connect with backend.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder: `cd frontend`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`.

The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder: `cd backend`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables.
4. Start the backend server: `npm start`.

The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:3001.
